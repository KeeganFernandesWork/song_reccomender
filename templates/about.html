    <p>This app provides an interactive platform for music analysis and recommendations.</p>
    <p>Using xgboost algorithm, it analyzes various audio features of songs to provide insights into their valence, danceability, duration, loudness, and more.</p>
    <p>With this app, you can explore the emotional and musical characteristics of your favorite songs and discover new tracks based on your preferences.</p>
